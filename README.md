# Web Services for Football Match Ticket Reservation
This project, carried out as part of a practical exam, aims to develop web services for a mobile application that allows users to reserve tickets for football matches.

The implemented features included adding a new fan, retrieving the list of fans based on the team, adding a new match, retrieving the list of matches, modifying the date of a match, reserving a ticket for a match, and returning tickets for a fan.

Additionally, as part of the project, the solution was containerized by creating two separate containers: one for the MongoDB database and another for the Node.js application.
