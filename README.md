# Web Services for Football Match Ticket Reservation

This project, carried out as part of a practical exam, aims to develop web services for a mobile application that allows users to reserve tickets for football matches. The services are built using Express.js.

The implemented features include adding a new fan, retrieving the list of fans based on the team, adding a new match, retrieving the list of matches, modifying the date of a match, reserving a ticket for a match, and returning tickets for a fan.

Additionally, as part of the project, the solution was containerized using Docker. Two separate containers were created: one for the MongoDB database, providing efficient data storage, and another for the Node.js application, allowing seamless deployment and scaling of the web services.
